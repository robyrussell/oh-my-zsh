# Put files in this folder to add your own custom functionality.
# For example: add shortcuts to your local projects. See: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Customization
#
# Files in the custom/ directory will be:
# - loaded automatically by the init script, in alphabetical order
# - loaded last, after all built-ins in the lib/ directory, to override them
# - now loaded by git commit
#
# Example: add custom/shortcuts.zsh for shortcuts to your local projects
